# lemonade_stand
You have 7 days to make as much money as possible, and you’ve decided to open a lemonade stand!  Set your recipe, buy your ingredients, and start selling!

At the beginning of everyday a weather report will be displayed.  Pay attention to the temperature and weather condition as that will affect how many customers you will have. Then choose your recipe and set the price for your lemonade.  Be careful not to charge to much as this will also affect how many customers you will have.

Purchase your ingredients with your starting budget of $25.  Don’t try to spend more than that, there is no credit in this game.

At the end of each days you’ll see how much money you made that day and a running total of the profit and loss from that week.. Play again, and try to beat your high score!
